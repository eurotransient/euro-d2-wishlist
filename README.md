# euro-d2-wishlist

## Update 6/15/2021

Changing things around here. The single wishlist file has been a bit cumbersome to curate and add to in an organized fashion. This would be fine for set and forget, but I'd also like to take an opportunity to better review the perk combos with the benefit of time and experience to further curate things down, and digging through a single file is less than ideal. Additionally, things will increasingly cement over time, meaning as we get further out from a weapon's introduction, I'll feel less compelled to tinker with it, essentially solidifying it.

Rather than constantly update a single file, I'm starting the process of breaking the full wishlist out into distinct files. At the moment the plan is to focus on Seasons, Raids, Dungeons (maybe?), and Iron Banner. Essentially, any unique grouping that can be granularly updated.

As this is a work in progress, things may change a bit from time to time. Possibilities include removing dungeon.txt and ib.txt and folding them into their appropriate seasons.

dim path.txt will contain a full string, pipe separated, and ready to use in DIM to include all wishlists. That said, if you prefer to focus on a single list, you can pick and choose.

euro_d2_wl.txt will slowly be phased out as that was the original file and all rolls within will end up in their more granular lists over time as this repository is updated.

## Original Intro

Just a personal refinement of my ideal rolls. I lean more into the PvE sandbox, and you'll find that my perk choices often reflect that preference. If you're looking for PvP god rolls, I may be missing a number of those. That said, as I build this project out, I'll make more effort to also touch on PvP. I also tend to feel pretty broadly about first and second column perks, so you may not find extreme refinement in those columns, though they do not go unaddressed. Masterworks are not included as part of my wishlist, as I find those to largely be added bonuses that reflect personal preference more than essentials.

To use this wishlist in DIM, visit your [settings page](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/settings) and navigate to the Wish List section. You'll see an option to supply the URL for a wish list. You can add multiple wishlists (including keeping the default voltron list) by pipe separating the URLs there. The direct URL to my wishlist is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurotransient/euro-d2-wishlist/master/euro_d2_wl.txt

Essential tool to building out the perk combos to add here is this [Cheat Sheet](https://48klocs.github.io/wish-list-magic-wand/fingerwave.html): This will generate the DIM tags based on plain text perk names.

## To Dos
* Add entries for all weapons.
* Further refine those entries, particularly ones added early in this process.
* Set up a table of contents of some sort, to keep better track of what's been added and what hasn't.
