# euro-d2-wishlist

Just a personal wishlist for Destiny 2. Primarily using Expert Mode instructions located [here](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/blob/master/docs/COMMUNITY_CURATIONS.md).

End goal is to more accurately curate DIM to my own tastes, and will likely be an ongoing work in progress.

Here's some useful links for my own future reference:

* [Destiny Sets Data Explorer](https://data.destinysets.com/): Required data is the hash value, which is printed next to the name of the item you're viewing. **Important note**: There's a number of types of items available, but sure to choose the InventoryItem data set to get the correct hash.
* [Cheat Sheet](https://48klocs.github.io/wish-list-magic-wand/fingerwave.html): This will generate the DIM tags based on entries from the data explorer.

Also, while I certainly have my own tastes, I also -- like most people! -- rely on the strength of the community to help me make decisions about preferred rolls. To that end, I find [the spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTnSQjqBqEqBQY3R203V5Y5b0il4gSeOIiPlsJfEErGfztmx9BHxzBA9wPlFo8oFMHNOddqrjpmx-hZ/pubhtml) to be invaluable to helping me decide on rolls that may be less than perfect. Note that this was created during Season of Arrivals, so if a browser comes across this later, take that into consideration.
