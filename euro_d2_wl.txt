title:euro's Destiny 2 Wishlist
description: Hi! I go by euro, or eurotransient in game and on Twitter. This reflects my own personal preferences in Destiny 2 and is going to be a long time work in progress. If you happen across this list you are of course welcome to use it, but please note that nothing here is a recommendation beyond the fact that it is either a perk set I personally enjoy or one that would like to find.
